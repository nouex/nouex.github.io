I tried to include as much detail bc when you are in jail you can’t just whip out your little smartphone and google stuff or make calls. I’ll wire you money for the bondsman/lawyer or for whatever will be needed.

All of this is probably wayyy too much for what will actually happen, if anything 🤞, but it’s better to be over prepared than to not be. Fear comes with something new and unexpected, this is my effort to avoid that.

If I’m arrested it will take a few hours to be processed and make a phone call. Once I have access to a phone I’ll call you and notify you. After this, don’t be surprised if I don’t call you for even a full 24 hours, phone access might be really restricted. Know that I am fine and being taken care of :)

Terms
———
Arraignment - Arraignment is a formal reading of a criminal charging document in the presence of the defendant, to inform them of the charges against them. This is usually when the judge sets your bail amount depending on the charge, criminal history, etc.

Own recognizance release (OR Release) in Nevada is when a judge permits a person who has been arrested for a crime to be released from jail without paying bail

Goals:
———
The goal is to get away with everything obviously, however you rarely ever get exactly what you want. During these hard times the biggest and most delicate things we must protect:

1. parents finding out. I won’t have my phone and my mom will eventually text me, she won’t hear back from me and at some point she’ll hit you up asking if I’m ok. Tell her I lost my phone and that I’m fine. Keep the cover story generic. Dont’ tell her my situation until I tell you to tell them.

2. employment at Vegas.com. My empoyer won’t like it if I miss too many days. One day of missing work is ok but eventually it’ll take a toll on my work performance.

Bail Bondsmen in Vegas
————————————
Here’s a list of bondsmen you should hit up. I did some basic research and this order is my preference but in the end go with whatever idc. Maybe even call a few to compare them and pick the most favorable one as far as how soon they can get me out and how much interest they charge. Note: I’m not worried if they ask for a collateral bc when everything is over I’ll get that back so don’t include collateral in price comparison.

2. Free Bail Bonds - https://www.freebailbondsagency.com/
3. eBail Cheap Bail Bonds  https://ebaillv.com

Some info a bondsmen will need from you:
1. full name and DOB
2. location of jail (i will probably tell you this on the phone)
3. booking # and charges (this too)
4. bond amount (they can look this up with my name and stuff)

Hiring a Lawyer
——————-
If you get here then that means bail was denied and I can’t do my research to hire a lawyer. This will be tricky bc lawyers will 99% of the time refuse to take cases from outside of the state. Since my case is in Utah County I’m not sure how that will work. Law firms usually have free phone consultations, tell them my situation and see what advice they give you. When doing research google criminal lawyers in Utah County. Do some research, make a few phone calls, and write down what you find.

You should inquire about:
1. their pricing
2. their advice on how to deal with a case from Utah County and the arrest being in Vegas

They will ask you for:
1. my charge (you can ask any bondsman to lookup my name in the system and it should come up)
2. what happened exactly
3. where I am located

“My Situation”
————————
Tell the lawyer the truth. Tell them about the plants and the other thing. Tell them I did it in revenge cuz homie had been bugging me with his superiority in the house and also his weirdo shit he pulled off on the last day pissed me off. Tell them I was drunk and it was for revenge and not random malice.

Scenarios
—————
1.
	a. arrest happens
	b. bail is denied
	c. this is bad bc who knows how long I’ll be there before court date. It’s your job to find a lawyer to try to negotiate a bail.
	d. follow the advice of the lawyer from here…
2.
	a. arrest happens
	b. bail is set
	c. hit up a bailbondsman (see list below)
	d. i’m free and can hire a lawyer myself if I need one
3.
	a. arrest happens
	b. wait until my arraignment (usually same day or next day) and judge lets me go on “own recognizance”
4.
	a. find out I have a warrant and cross the border into mexico.
	b. write you letters from the land of the Aztecs

Ok, I think I’m finished. Vegas is a safe haven from all of this. I doubt what happened in Provo will follow me to Vegas but as always, expect the worst and hope for the best.
